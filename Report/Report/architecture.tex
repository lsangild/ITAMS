\chapter{Architecture}
\label{sec:Architecture}
This section describes the overall system architecture, the chosen platforms for development and how the different subsystems communicate with each other.

\section{Choice of components}
The physical entities necessary to solve the tasks of the blocks identified in \cref{fig:BDD:unspecified} are as follows:

\paragraph{Controller and Data transfer} can be performed by a single module. The \MKR which includes a \SAMD ARM µC and a u-blox SARA-U201-03B-00 High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) with 2G fallback module for internet access\cite{MKRGSM1400}.
They communicate using one of the two UARTs available on the \SAMD ARM µC.
The \SAMD ARM µC uses \SI{< 15}{\milli\ampere} while running \cite[p.~791-794]{SAMD21}.
The SARA-U201 uses a maximum of \SI{1.9}{\ampere} when transferring data \cite[p.~26]{SARAU201} and less than \SI{1}{\milli\ampere} when in power-saving mode. Alternatively the known Arduino MEGA2560 with an external GSM module could be used, but this has been opted against in favour of using an integrated low power module.

\paragraph{Locator} has to be able to locate itself globally. This is solved using a GNSS module, u-blox NEO-7M-0-000, from Embedded Stock.
The module is able to use GPS (with SBAS and QZSS) and GLONASS, allowing for global positioning.
It also uses a maximum of \SI{67}{\milli\ampere} \cite[p.~17]{NEO7_Data} and is the low power version from the NEO-7 series.
The breakout-board exposes the UART connection, which can be used to communicate with the controller.

\paragraph{Memory} has to be non-volatile and able to store at least 1440 locations.
This is accomplished using a SD-card with \SI{2}{\giga\byte} of memory, allowing for each location to be up to \SI{1.39}{\mega\byte}.
The connection to the \SDsock SD-card breakout board\cite{Ciseco} is SPI which is directly available on the \MKR module.

\section{Communication}
With the chosen components, the interfaces between them can be identified, as shown in \cref{fig:IBD:overall}.
The communication between the \SAMD and the \SARA module are presoldered to UART.
The breakout-board for the \GPS exposes UART ports and the SD-card breakout-board exposes SPI ports.
Connection to the server is chosen to be UDP with an acknowledge from the server.

\section{Sequence Diagrams}
The sequence diagrams (SD) below are meant to give an understanding of the inner workings of the \systemName.

Initiation of the system is described in \cref{fig:SD:init}.
It shows the µC initiating itself and then the external blocks.
The GPS module is polled until it returns valid location data. The time returned from the GPS allows the µC know the time and run the desired actions either at certain intervals, e.g. every 10 minutes, or at specific times, e.g. every full hour.
When valid data has been retrieved it is saved to the SD card and the GPS and GSM modules are put to sleep to conserve power.
The acquisition of GPS location is shown in \cref{fig:SD:getlocation}.
The GPS starts in a sleep mode and is awoken to find it's location.
When the location is found and is valid, the GPS is put back to sleep and the data is saved tot he SD card.
To upload data to the server, the GSM must be awoken and data must be retrieved from the SD card, as shown in \cref{fig:SD:upload}.
When the data has been sent the GSM is put back to sleep.
