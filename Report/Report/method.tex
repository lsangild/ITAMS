\chapter{Process}
This chapter describes the way the group has worked to complete the project and describes the overall working structure used in the project.
Early in the process a roadmap for the different phases of the project was produced. This was done to give the group an overview of the entire process. The roadmap is shown in \cref{fig:planningtimeline}.
