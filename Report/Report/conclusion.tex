\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
The goal of the project has been to create a \systemName able to locate itself and send the location to a remote server, possibly sending at specified intervals to conserve power.
The final prototype incorporates an ARM µC, a GSM cellular module and a GPS module.

A great deal of work went into getting to know the \SAMD µC, this was a hindrance to the work flow.
As the \SAMD is built on the SAM structure and not the AVR structure, a lot of new registers had to be understood.
This could have been avoided by using the known ATmega2560.
This was opted against to increase the learning possibilities.
