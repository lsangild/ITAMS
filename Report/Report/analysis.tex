\chapter{Analysis}
This section describes the analysis of the system; how the system is envisioned to be created, which subsystems it will consist of and the tasks each subsystem has to be able to perform to meet the specified requirements.

To fulfil the specified requirements in \nameref{chap:requirements} a module to locate the system, save the location and send the location must be present. Additionally a processor is needed to facilitate communication between the modules. This system interfaces with a server as shown in \cref{fig:BDD:unspecified}

\section{Choice of components}
The physical entities necessary to solve the tasks of the blocks identified in \cref{fig:BDD:unspecified} are to be solved as follows:

\paragraph{Controller and Data transfer} can be performed by a single module. The \MKR which includes a \SAMD ARM µC and a u-blox SARA-U201-03B-00 High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) with 2G fallback module for internet access.
They communicate using one of the two UARTs available on the \SAMD ARM µC.
The \SAMD ARM µC uses \SI{< 15}{\milli\ampere} while running \cite[p.~791-794]{SAMD21}.
The SARA-U201 uses a maximum of \SI{1.9}{\ampere} when transferring data \cite[p.~26]{SARAU201} and less than \SI{1}{\milli\ampere} when in power-saving mode.

\paragraph{Locator} has to be able to locate itself globally. This is solved using a GNSS module, u-blox NEO-7M-0-000, from Embedded Stock.
The module is able to use GPS (with SBAS and QZSS) and GLONASS, allowing for global positioning.
It also uses a maximum of \SI{67}{\milli\ampere} \cite[p.~17]{NEO7_Data} and is the low power version from the NEO-7 series.
The breakout-board exposes the UART connection, which can be used to communicate with the controller.

\paragraph{Memory} has to be non-volatile and able to store at least 1440 locations.
This is accomplished using a SD-card with \SI{2}{\giga\byte} of memory, allowing for each location to be up to \SI{1.39}{\mega\byte}.
The connection to the SD-card breakout board is SPI which is directly available on the \MKR module.

\section{Communication}
With the chosen components, the interfaces between them can be identified, as shown in \cref{fig:IBD:overall}.
The communication between the \SAMD and the \SARA module are forced to UART.
The breakout-board for the NEO-7M exposes UART ports and the SD-card breakout-board exposes SPI ports.
Connection to the server is chosen to be UDP with an acknowledge from the server.
