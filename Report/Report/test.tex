\chapter{Test}
In this section an short introduction to how this project has used test from beginning to the end will be described.

\section{Module test}
Unit tests has been performed on the \GPS GPS module, the \SARA GSM module and the \SDsock SD-card socket with SD-card inserted.

\subsection{GPS \GPS}
The GPS module is tested by connecting it to a USB to UART module and sending the appropriate UBX commands. The setting is outdoors as to achieve the most precise localization.

\section{Acceptance Test}
Acceptance tests were formed directly in succession of the Use Cases were, and have been updated throughout the project to fit the direction of the system. They have been used to benchmark the system and determine when a particular feature is complete.
