\label{sec:Abstract}
The focus of this project has been to investigate a possible way of building a portable location tracking device, capable of sending it's location to a remote server.
The device had, at a minimum, to be able to locate itself and send the location to a remote server.

The chosen modules that make up the \systemName are a \GPS GPS module, an \MKR combined micro controller and GPRS module and a \SDsock SPI to micro SD socket.
The SD card socket has not been implemented.

The modules has been successfully tested on their own and as part of a system context.
The \systemName is, at the end of development, able to locate itself and send the location data to a remote server.
