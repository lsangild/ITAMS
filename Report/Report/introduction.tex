\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
As different Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are developed (GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO and Beidou) and low power devices (IoT) blooms, it seems obvious to combine them.
The combination can lead to different quality of life (QOL) improvements, such as coffee being ready when you get home, health care personnel being alerted if a person leaves the premises, the ability to find something you have lost and so forth.
