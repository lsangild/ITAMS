\label{sec:Abstract}
The idea behind this project has been to bring a more special feeling to the Friday bar at "Katrines KÃ¦lder".
There is currently next to little implication that the bar is designated for engineering students.
We want to change this by introducing \systemName.

Our vision of \systemName is an ordering and delivery service for beverages which can server multiple customers directly or in a game mode with characteristics drawn from the famous video game franchise Mario Kart.
Our thought solution to the problem is a system consisting of a mobile application on which a user can order displayed beverages, an interface for the bartender listing orders and a delivery vehicle stabilising the ordered beverage and capable of being controlled by the same previously mentioned mobile application.

The produced prototype is capable of letting a user order a beverage from the bar, on an Android smartphone app, and show the bartender the order.
When the order has been completed, and placed on a special motorized vehicle by the bartender, the user gains control off the vehicle through the previously mentioned Android app.
The vehicle, now being controlled by the user, has a holder for the order which is capable of reducing spillage by keeping the beverage levelled until it arrives at the location of user.
