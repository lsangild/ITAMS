\chapter{Requirements}
\label{chap:requirements}
In this chapter the requirements for the system will be described.
No use cases have been produced as the target of this project is rather simple.
In stead the MoSCoW below will be used to describe the functions of the system and the prioritization.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Must}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Communicate with a server over wast distances.
		\item Retrieve global positional data.
		\item Send location data to server.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Should}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Save location data to non-volatile memory.
		\item Employ power saving functions when not being used.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Could}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Allow for wireless updates.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Won't}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Log movement data.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Must draw a maximum of \SI{500}{\milli\ampere} at peak, to be able to be driven from a USB 2.0 port.
	\item Must be able to locate itself within \SI{1}{\minute}.
	\item Should be able to store at least \num{1440} locations (one data point per minute for \num{24} hours).
